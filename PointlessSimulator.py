""" There's a UK game show called pointless, in which 4 pairs compete to win a cash prize.
If you don't win the first game you appear on, you can appear in the next game, but if
you fail twice or win either time, you're out. One of the hosts (Richard Osman) remarked
once that they had 4 new players, and that that was a rare occurrence. I thought that it
surely couldn't be, so I built this.

This script randomly simulates games of Pointless. After the 10th game, it begins counting
how many new teams (labelled here as "players") are in that game.
